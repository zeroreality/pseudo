/**
 * @preserve pseudo3 stand-alone JavaScript utility library
 * This library extends the functionality of the DOM by changing the object prototypes.
 * Normally this approach is frowned upon because it can cause issue with other libraries if they do the same.
 * However, I don't care, since I don't use other libraries.
